# 👋 Hi There

## ✨ Introduction
I am currently a **Master of Science candidate in Computer Science** at the **University of Information Technology (UIT)**, specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. My ongoing thesis focuses on **Social Implicit Emotion Analysis (SoIEA)**.

Beyond academia, I am a builder at heart. I bridge the gap between AI research and production engineering. My experience ranges from curating complex datasets for AI models (submitted to AAAI) to architecting scalable data pipelines using **Apache Kafka & PySpark**, and building high-performance backends with **Golang**.

## 🚀 Career Goals
I aim to join a product-driven team where I can leverage my hybrid background in **Data Engineering, AI, and Backend Development**. My goal is to not just build software, but to architect intelligent, scalable systems that solve complex real-world problems.
